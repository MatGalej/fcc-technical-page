                <p>Proxmox is an open-source virtualization platform that combines KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)
                    for
                    virtual machines (VMs) and LXC (Linux Containers) for lightweight containers. It offers a powerful
                    web-based interface for managing virtualized environments, including clustering, backup solutions,
                    and software-defined storage.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Virtualization: Supports both VMs and containers for different workload needs.</li>
                    <li>High Availability (HA): Allows clustering of multiple nodes for fail over capabilities.</li>
                    <li>Backup and Restore: Built-in support for backup and snapshot management.</li>

                        <h3>Networking Basics</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>IP Addressing: Understand static vs. dynamic IPs, subnetting, and gateways.</li>
                            <li>DHCP: Know how Proxmox might obtain or require a static IP during setup.</li>
                            <li>DNS: Properly configure hostname and DNS for network functionality.</li>
                            <li>Bridges and VLANs: Proxmox relies on bridges for VM networking. Understand how bridges
                                emulate a switch to connect VMs to the physical network.

            <section class="main-section" id="System_Requirements">
                <header><h1>System Requirements</h1></header>
                <p>Before setting up Proxmox, it's important to have a solid understanding of the platform and its
                    requirements. Proxmox requires a 64-bit processor with virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
                    and at least 4 GB of RAM, though 16 GB or more is recommended for production environments. For
                    storage,
                    using SSDs enhances performance, and configurations like ZFS require additional RAM (1 GB per 1 TB
                    of
                    storage is suggested). Networking basics, such as IP addressing, VLANs, and bridges, are also
                    essential,
                    as Proxmox uses Linux bridges to connect virtual machines to physical networks. When clustering
                    nodes
                    for high availability, ensure time synchronization using NTP and low-latency network connections to
                    facilitate Corosync communication between nodes.
                    <br><br>
                    Storage flexibility is one of Proxmox's strengths. Local storage works well for small setups, but
                    ZFS
                    is a better choice for features like snapshots and replication. Ceph is another option for
                    distributed,
                    scalable storage in multi-node environments. For networking, VLAN tagging and SDN provide the
                    flexibility needed for complex setups, such as multi-tenant environments. Finally, Proxmox supports
                    multiple backup modes, including snapshot-based backups (ideal with ZFS) and integration with the
                    Proxmox Backup Server for efficient deduplication and compression.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Installation">
                <header><h1>Installation</h1></header>
                <h2>Initial Installation</h2>
                <p>To install Proxmox, download the ISO from the
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox website</a>, create a bootable USB
                    drive
                    using a tool like Rufus or Balena Etcher, and boot your server from the USB. Follow the
                    guided installation steps, specifying the disk for installation, network settings, and the root
                    password.</p>

                <h2>Creating Virtual Machines</h2>
                <p>To create a virtual machine, navigate to Datacenter > Node > Create VM in the web interface.
                    Provide a name for the VM, select the ISO for the operating system, and configure CPU, memory,
                    and storage settings. Complete the wizard and start the VM.</p>

                <h2>Creating Containers</h2>
                <p>Creating a container involves navigating to Datacenter > Node > Create CT,
                    selecting a template (which can be downloaded via the interface), and configuring CPU,
                    memory, and network settings. Containers can be managed via the web interface or command line,
                    offering lightweight virtualization for specific workloads.</p>

                <h2>Setting up High Availability (HA)</h2>
                <p>High availability in Proxmox requires a cluster of nodes. Start by creating a cluster on the
                    primary node: <br><br><code class="code-block">pvecm create &ltcluster-name&gt</code></p>
                <p>Then, add additional nodes to the cluster:
                    <br><br><code class="code-block">pvecm add &ltprimary-node-ip&gt</code></p>
                <p>Once the cluster is set up, enable HA for specific VMs or containers via the web interface.</p>

                <h2>Configuring ZFS Storage</h2>
                <p>ZFS can be set up during installation or added later. To create a ZFS pool, use the following
                    command:
                    <br><br><code class="code-block">zpool create mypool /dev/sdX</code></p>
                <p>Add the ZFS pool in the Proxmox GUI under Datacenter > Storage > Add ZFS.
                    Snapshots can be created using: <br><br><code class="code-block">zfs snapshot
                        mypool/dataset@snapshot-name</code></p>

                <h2>Networking</h2>
                <p>Proxmox uses Linux bridges to connect VMs to external networks. You can configure these under
                    System > Network in the web interface. To add a VLAN, use the following command:
                    <br><br><code class="code-block">ip link add link eth0 name eth0.10 type vlan id 10</code></p>
                <p>This allows for isolated network configurations and enhanced network management.</p>

                <h2>Backup and Restore</h2>
                <p>Backups can be scheduled under Datacenter > Backup. Select the desired backup mode
                    (snapshot, stop, or suspend) and configure the schedule. Restoring a VM is as simple as navigating
                    to the backup file and selecting Restore.</p>

                <h2>Ceph Cluster Storage</h2>
                <p>For distributed storage, Ceph can be installed on Proxmox nodes: <br><br><code class="code-block">
                    apt install ceph
                </code></p>
                <p>Create a Ceph cluster via the web interface or CLI and add Ceph storage pools to Proxmox for use by
                    VMs and containers.</p>

                <h2>Monitoring and Logs</h2>
                <p>Proxmox includes built-in monitoring tools for tracking CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network traffic.
                    Logs can be accessed for troubleshooting under Datacenter > Syslog in the GUI.</p>

                <h2>Cluster and Node Management</h2>
                <p>To add nodes to a cluster, run the following command on the secondary node: <br><br><code
                        class="code-block">pvecm add &ltIP of master node&gt</code></p>
                <p>Live VM migrations can be performed through the GUI by selecting the VM and clicking Migrate.</p>

                <p>To get the most out of Proxmox, set up a robust backup strategy using the Proxmox Backup Server or
                    third-party tools. Experiment in a lab environment to test configurations before deploying them in
                    production. Secure your Proxmox system with regular updates, strong passwords, and firewalls.
                    Finally,
                    leverage the Proxmox forums and documentation for troubleshooting and learning. By following these
                    steps
                    and guidelines, you'll be well-equipped to deploy and manage a Proxmox system effectively.</p>
