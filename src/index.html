            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Proxmox is an open-source virtualization platform that combines KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for
                virtual machines (VMs) and LXC (Linux Containers) for lightweight containers. It offers a powerful
                web-based interface for managing virtualized environments, including clustering, backup solutions,
                and software-defined storage.</p>
            <p>Key features of Proxmox include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Virtualization: Supports both VMs and containers for different workload needs.</li>
                <li>High Availability (HA): Allows clustering of multiple nodes for failover capabilities.</li>
                <li>Backup and Restore: Built-in support for backup and snapshot management.</li>
                <li>Storage Flexibility: Integrates with local storage, ZFS, Ceph, and more.</li>

            <h1>System Requirements</h1>
            <p>Before setting up Proxmox, it's important to have a solid understanding of the platform and its
                requirements. Proxmox requires a 64-bit processor with virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
                and at least 4 GB of RAM, though 16 GB or more is recommended for production environments. For storage,
                using SSDs enhances performance, and configurations like ZFS require additional RAM (1 GB per 1 TB of
                storage is suggested). Networking basics, such as IP addressing, VLANs, and bridges, are also essential,
                as Proxmox uses Linux bridges to connect virtual machines to physical networks. When clustering nodes
                for high availability, ensure time synchronization using NTP and low-latency network connections to
                facilitate Corosync communication between nodes.
                <br><br>
                Storage flexibility is one of Proxmox's strengths. Local storage works well for small setups, but ZFS is a better choice for features like snapshots and replication. Ceph is another option for distributed, scalable storage in multi-node environments. For networking, VLAN tagging and SDN provide the flexibility needed for complex setups, such as multi-tenant environments. Finally, Proxmox supports multiple backup modes, including snapshot-based backups (ideal with ZFS) and integration with the Proxmox Backup Server for efficient deduplication and compression.</p>
